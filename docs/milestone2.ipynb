    "## Introduction\n",
    "Differentiation is used in many applications, such as finding stationary points of defined functions or minimizing objective loss functions in machine learning applications. \n",
    "But differentiating an arbitrary function &#8477;<sup>n</sup> &#8594; &#8477;<sup>m</sup> is generally not an easy task. \n",
    "When the function can be expressed as a composition of differentiable elementary functions (which in most cases is true), Automatic Differentiation (AD) can help. \n",
    "AD has become one of the most popular techniques for finding derivatives and is often preferred over symbolic differentation and numerical differentiation because of its efficiency and stability."

    " \n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "How does AD do it? AD takes an input function and breaks it down into a set of elementary functions. It uses symbolic differentiation of the elementary functions to calculate their derivatives at specific values. These elementary functions are then combined using common mathematical functions, such as addition or multiplication. The derivatives of the combined functions (which we will refer to as nodes) can be found using the chain rule and the derivatives calculated from the earlier elementary functions. This process repeats (as more complex functions are combined) until the full functions derivative has been calculated. As an example, if you want to compute the derivative of *sin(tan(xy) + cos(x + y))* you can first compute the derivatives w.r.t *x* and *y* of *tan(xy)* and *cos(x + y)*, then add those together, and then get the derivative of the entire function using the chain rule. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two common methods for implementing AD, forward mode and backward mode (of which the popular backpropagation algorithm for neural networks is a special case). Given a function &#8477;<sup>n</sup> &#8594; &#8477;<sup>m</sup>, forward mode fixes the independent variables or input (n) to solve for m outputs; whereas backward mode fixes the dependent variables or outputs (m). This means that forward mode is more efficient when m>>n and backward mode is more efficient when n>>m. That's why backward mode is more common in \"big data\" problems where there are often far more features than data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The AD process can be represented using either the computational trace or the computation graph. The computational trace is a table that stores the elementary and intermediary functions, their derivatives, and the derivative values evaluated at an input (if provided). This process can also be visually representated using a computational graph, where nodes are rows in the computational trace and arrows show how nodes are combined and by what elementary operations.

    "#### Implementation (4/5)\n",
    "1. You needed a more in-depth explanation of how you will deal with vector-valued functions. Don't you use too much code. \n",
    "\n",
    "In funkyAD we define 3 main classes: AD, Node, and ElementaryFunction. AD is the class that the user will interact with. It takes in an arbitrary function from the user and calls the necessary functions and classes in order to calculate the gradient. It will have transparently named methods and syntactic sugar when appropriate. The user should not know how anything else in the library works for simple usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Node class is essentially a row in our trace table, it has subclasses for input nodes (InputNode) and output nodes (OutputNodes). Nodes are connected and can be added or multiplied together to form new nodes, via the dunder methods\\_\\_add\\_\\_ etc, which allows us to build up the trace table. Dual numbers are essentially encoded as the pair (Node.val, Node.grad_val) in our implementation, and additions/operation are performed when calling ElementaryFunction(Node1, Node2). A Node is, essentially, an extension of the Box class in HW4. If the user has defined a function f, we will call f(InputNode(input)) and the successive operation performed on that node will allow us to recover the evaluation trace.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ElementaryFunction Class defines the functions and derivatives of elementary functions passed in by the user, such as sin, log, etc. We also allow the user to add their own elementary function to the list if we do not include the elementary function they need in the initial library list. An appropriate exception is raised if the user tries to utilize a function that is not defined as an instance of the ElementaryFunction class.\n",
